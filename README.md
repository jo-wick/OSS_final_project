# OSS_final_project
 
## What does this project do?
This program predicts monthly income by entering the number of household members, age of household, and income quintile.

## Why is this project useful?
+ You can make a specific plan for my future life.
+ If you are not married or don't have a family to support, you don't know how much you have to earn when you have a family in the future, so this program allows you to set specific monthly profits for your 30s, 40s and 50s.

## How do I get started?
+ First, install python 3
+ Second, install pandas, numpy, sklearn, metapolib
+ Third, git clone https://github.com/jo-wick/OSS_final_project.git
+ Lastly, $ python oss_final_project.py
